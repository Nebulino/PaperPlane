                           A-1. DEFINITIONS

  0. “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.

  1. "This Licence" refers to the version 1.apricot of NEBULINO PUBLIC LICENSE
 No one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
 publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
 distinguishing version number.

  2. “Work" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as “You” in this document.
“Licensees” and “recipients” may be an individual, or individuals or organizations.

  3. To “Modify” a Work means the action of copying or adapting part or the whole Work
in a fashion that requires the copyright permission, other than making
an exact copy of the the Work.
The resulting Work is then called “a modified version” of the work based on the earlier Work,
"based on" the previous work.

  4. The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  5. "The author" refers to "author" of the code, which is the one that made
the particular code that exists inside of the Corresponding Source.

  6. "Owner" refers to any group which are owning the Corresponding Source.

  7. "Maintainers" refers to any group which are keeping in existence or
continuance, preserving and retaining The Work and the Corresponding Source.

  8. “Deprecation” refers to an act of The author and Owner without the agreement
of the Maintainers, or even just one maintainer, to discontinuing the support
and the maintenance of The Work.

  9. "Discontinuation" refers to The Author and/or Owner and or all Maintainers to
discontinuing the support and the maintenance of The Work.

  10.  "Upstream" refers to the place or site where The Work and the
Corresponding Source getting worked on and where The Author and Owner and the Maintainers,
keeping the existence, continuance, preservation, and the maintainer-ship of
The Work and Corresponding Source.

     A-2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Works a copy of this License; and

the Corresponding Source or optionally removing The Work entirely and
